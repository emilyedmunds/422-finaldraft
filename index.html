				<h2> About UPE </h2>

				<h2> Our Connections</h2>
				<p>Our chapter thrives on its diversity and would not be the same without each and every member contributing their unique experiences and perspectives. In addition to their dedication to UPE, our brothers are also student leaders for other organizations on campus, interns at a plethora of companies, research assistants, and instructional aides for their classes. During rush, we do not discriminate by school, major, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, or background; rather, we celebrate our brotherhood’s diversity and ultimately all come together united by our passion for technology. UPE has received endorsements from the two largest computer organizations in the world, the
					<a href = "https://www.acm.org/">Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</a> 
					and and the <a href = "https://www.computer.org/">IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS)</a>. UPE is also a charter member of <a href = "https://www.ifees.net/">The International Federation of Engineering Education Societies (IFEES)</a>.</p>
